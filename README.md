by Yue Wu, Hangqi Ding, Maoguo Gong, A. K. Qin, Wenping Ma, Qiguang Miao, Kay Chen Tan, and details are in [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9925083).

## Usage
1.Description of running environment: The packaged executable is done with the help of MATLAB Compiler, so the user needs to download Runtime.
  MATLAB Runtime is a set of independent shared libraries, which can run compiled MATLAB applications or components without installing MATLAB.
2.The project folder provided includes 4 folders and 1 file:
  * for_redistribution: the file used to install the application and MATLAB Runtime, the runtime environment under this folder is installed before running the           packaged executable;
  * for_redistribution_files_only: the packaged standalone executables;
  * for_testing: files created by MCC, like binaries and jars, headers and source files, which are used to test the effect of packaging;
  * PackagingLog.html: log files generated by the compiler; .prj: is simply ignored.
3.Run the .exe file on a computer without Matlab installed, and place the folder on a computer without Matlab installed at:
  Run the MyAppInstaller_web.exe file in for_redistribution to install Matlab Runtime;
  Run the .exe file in for_redistribution_files_only, and you can find that the program runs successfully and shows the point cloud alignment visualization result graph.

## Dataset
* [The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/).
