## Introduction

This paper proposes a self-supervised point cloud understanding method called CrossNet. CrossNet is simple and efficient, developing the intra-modal contrastive loss between the point clouds and the cross-modal contrastive loss between the point clouds and images. Finally, we combine the overall training objectives.

## Download data

Datasets are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dAH9R3XDV0z69Bz6lBaftmJJyuckbPmR?usp=sharing). Run the command below to download all the datasets (ShapeNetRender, ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNetPart) to reproduce the results. Additional [S3DIS](http://buildingparser.stanford.edu/dataset.html) is optional.

```
cd data
source download_data.sh
```

## Train CrossNet

Refer `python train_crossnet_con.py` for the command to train CrossNet.

## Downstream Tasks

### 1. 3D Object Classification 

Run `downstream/classification/main.py`  to perform linear SVM object classification in both ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets.


### 2. 3D Object Part Segmentation

Refer `downstream/segmentation/main_partseg.py` for fine-tuning experiment for part segmentation in ShapeNetPart dataset.

### 3. 3D Object Semantic Segmentation

Refer `downstream/segmentation/main_semseg.py` for fine-tuning experiment for semantic segmentation in S3DIS dataset.
