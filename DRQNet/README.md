## Introduction

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the dual representation query network (DRQNet). The proposed framework partitions the input point cloud into position and color spaces, using the separately extracted geometric structure and semantic context to create an internal supervisory mechanism that bridges the dual spaces and fuses the information. Adopting sparsely annotated points as the query set, DRQNet provide guidance and perceptual information for multi-stage point clouds through random sampling. More, to differentiate and enhance the features generated by local neighbourhoods within multiple perceptual fields, we design a representation selection module to identify the contributions made by the position and color of each query point, and weight them adaptively according to reliability.

## Train DRQNet

First, follow the RandLA-Net [instruction](https://github.com/QingyongHu/RandLA-Net) to prepare the dataset.

- Start training with weakly supervised setting:
```
python main_S3DIS.py --mode train --gpu 0 --labeled_point 0.1%
```
- Evaluation:
```
python main_S3DIS.py --mode test --gpu 0 --labeled_point 0.1%
```
